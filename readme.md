This code runs commputation of Yodzis-Innes 3-species model.
Refer to the report ('UEFK01_report_3-species_model_v2.pdf') for more detail description of the modelling process.

Start the modelling by running main.m.
    run_studied_systems; % Run two studied systems as mentioned in report
    run_param: Examining the varying parameters in Yodzis-Innes 3-species model 

It might take ~15 minutes for the whole program to finish.
The program saves result images to these folders a 'figures' folder, with eight subfolders naming R0, C0, xc, xp, yc, yp, S1 and S2 
(as attached 'figures' folder).
